# Gimbal Roadmap
## Last Updated: Aug 16, 2024

Due to the fragmentation of the space, it is impossible for Gimbal to support all possible hardware/sensors/models at once. Gimbal has a comprehensive roadmap to expand its support for more use cases and environments. A few of the key items are listed below:

- Expansion of supported sensor/model modalities: Gimbal currently focuses on computer vision models, but we plan to extend support to audio, timeseries, etc.
- Expansion of OS support: Currently only Linux is supported, but we plan to expand support to Windows, etc.
- Expansion of supported hardware: We want to add support for other accelerators such as SiMa, etc.

We welcome contributions in each of these areas as developers adopt Gimbal for their particular use cases and hardware.
