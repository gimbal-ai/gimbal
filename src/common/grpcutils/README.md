# gRPC utils

APIs for working with gRPC services.

You may want to check out other tools:

*   [`grpc_cli`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/command_line_tool.md): Requires
    reflection on the service to operate. Wirtten in C++.
*   [`grpccurl`](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl): Requires reflection as well. This is
    written in Go, which is useful for our gRPC service poker, which will be written in Go as well.
