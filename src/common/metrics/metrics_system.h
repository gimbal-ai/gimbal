 * MetricsSystem is a wrapper around OTel metrics. It is structured such that it is
 * system-wide, with a single instance for the whole system.
 *
 * Creating stats:
 *
 * GetMeterProvider() can be used to create and add to new stats.
 * This pretty much gives direct access to OTel, so please follow OTel documentation for types
 * of stats and how to use them. There is a basic example included in the test for this file.
 *
 * Consuming stats:
 *
 * On the reader side, the CollectAllAsProto() can be used to extract all the stats in an OTel
 * defined protobuf, or Reader() can be called to set-up your own callback of how to process the
 * stats.
 *
 * The initial implementation of this metrics system is intentionally simple, avoid things like
 * OTel views. We may add these in the future, depending on the complexity of the stats collection.
