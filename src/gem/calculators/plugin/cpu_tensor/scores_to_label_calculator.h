/**
 * ScoresToLabelCalculator Graph API:
 *
 * TODO(james): Currently this API modifies a Detection proto by changing a broad label into a more
 * specific one. We should probably reconsider our APIs and have this output a separate
 * "Classification" proto, that we can then merge with a Detection proto in a separate step.
 *
 *  Options:
 *    INDEX_TO_LABEL mapping from index to label.
 *  Inputs:
 *    SCORES CPUTensorPtr of shape NxC where N is batch size and C is number of classes.
 *    DETECTION Detection proto to add label to.
 *  Outputs:
 *    DETECTION Detection proto with label added.
