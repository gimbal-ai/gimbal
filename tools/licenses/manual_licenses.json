    "licenseText": "# License\n\nMost files in FFmpeg are under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1\nor later (LGPL v2.1+). Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` for details. Some other\nfiles have MIT/X11/BSD-style licenses. In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to\nFFmpeg.\n\nSome optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License\nversion 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file `COPYING.GPLv2` for details. None of\nthese parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass `--enable-gpl` to\nconfigure to activate them. In this case, FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.\n\nSpecifically, the GPL parts of FFmpeg are:\n\n- libpostproc\n- optional x86 optimization in the files\n    - `libavcodec/x86/flac_dsp_gpl.asm`\n    - `libavcodec/x86/idct_mmx.c`\n    - `libavfilter/x86/vf_removegrain.asm`\n- the following building and testing tools\n    - `compat/solaris/make_sunver.pl`\n    - `doc/t2h.pm`\n    - `doc/texi2pod.pl`\n    - `libswresample/tests/swresample.c`\n    - `tests/checkasm/*`\n    - `tests/tiny_ssim.c`\n- the following filters in libavfilter:\n    - `signature_lookup.c`\n    - `vf_blackframe.c`\n    - `vf_boxblur.c`\n    - `vf_colormatrix.c`\n    - `vf_cover_rect.c`\n    - `vf_cropdetect.c`\n    - `vf_delogo.c`\n    - `vf_eq.c`\n    - `vf_find_rect.c`\n    - `vf_fspp.c`\n    - `vf_histeq.c`\n    - `vf_hqdn3d.c`\n    - `vf_kerndeint.c`\n    - `vf_lensfun.c` (GPL version 3 or later)\n    - `vf_mcdeint.c`\n    - `vf_mpdecimate.c`\n    - `vf_nnedi.c`\n    - `vf_owdenoise.c`\n    - `vf_perspective.c`\n    - `vf_phase.c`\n    - `vf_pp.c`\n    - `vf_pp7.c`\n    - `vf_pullup.c`\n    - `vf_repeatfields.c`\n    - `vf_sab.c`\n    - `vf_signature.c`\n    - `vf_smartblur.c`\n    - `vf_spp.c`\n    - `vf_stereo3d.c`\n    - `vf_super2xsai.c`\n    - `vf_tinterlace.c`\n    - `vf_uspp.c`\n    - `vf_vaguedenoiser.c`\n    - `vsrc_mptestsrc.c`\n\nShould you, for whatever reason, prefer to use version 3 of the (L)GPL, then\nthe configure parameter `--enable-version3` will activate this licensing option\nfor you. Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv3` or, if you have enabled GPL parts,\n`COPYING.GPLv3` to learn the exact legal terms that apply in this case.\n\nThere are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely:\n\n* The files `libavcodec/jfdctfst.c`, `libavcodec/jfdctint_template.c` and\n  `libavcodec/jrevdct.c` are taken from libjpeg, see the top of the files for\n  licensing details. Specifically note that you must credit the IJG in the\n  documentation accompanying your program if you only distribute executables.\n  You must also indicate any changes including additions and deletions to\n  those three files in the documentation.\n* `tests/reference.pnm` is under the expat license.\n\n\n## External libraries\n\nFFmpeg can be combined with a number of external libraries, which sometimes\naffect the licensing of binaries resulting from the combination.\n\n### Compatible libraries\n\nThe following libraries are under GPL version 2:\n- avisynth\n- frei0r\n- libcdio\n- libdavs2\n- librubberband\n- libvidstab\n- libx264\n- libx265\n- libxavs\n- libxavs2\n- libxvid\n\nWhen combining them with FFmpeg, FFmpeg needs to be licensed as GPL as well by\npassing `--enable-gpl` to configure.\n\nThe following libraries are under LGPL version 3:\n- gmp\n- libaribb24\n- liblensfun\n\nWhen combining them with FFmpeg, use the configure option `--enable-version3` to\nupgrade FFmpeg to the LGPL v3.\n\nThe VMAF, mbedTLS, RK MPI, OpenCORE and VisualOn libraries are under the Apache License\n2.0. That license is incompatible with the LGPL v2.1 and the GPL v2, but not with\nversion 3 of those licenses. So to combine these libraries with FFmpeg, the\nlicense version needs to be upgraded by passing `--enable-version3` to configure.\n\nThe smbclient library is under the GPL v3, to combine it with FFmpeg,\nthe options `--enable-gpl` and `--enable-version3` have to be passed to\nconfigure to upgrade FFmpeg to the GPL v3.\n\n### Incompatible libraries\n\nThere are certain libraries you can combine with FFmpeg whose licenses are not\ncompatible with the GPL and/or the LGPL. If you wish to enable these\nlibraries, even in circumstances that their license may be incompatible, pass\n`--enable-nonfree` to configure. This will cause the resulting binary to be\nunredistributable.\n\nThe Fraunhofer FDK AAC and OpenSSL libraries are under licenses which are\nincompatible with the GPLv2 and v3. To the best of our knowledge, they are\ncompatible with the LGPL.\n"

This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
